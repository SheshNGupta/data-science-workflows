# Getting Started With an OPF Data Science Project

The outline below provides some helpful links to kick start the creation of a new data science project with the Operate First Data Science Community, outlining some of our suggested best practices and tool-kits.  

<br/>

## Organize and Structure a Project

* Review our project structure [doc](project-structure.md) and get a sense for the phases of a data science project.
*  Create a public git repository using our project template. Feel free to use the template directly or initialize your project via the cookiecutter tool.
    * [template repo](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/project-template)
    * [cookiecutter](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/cookiecutter-data-science) 
* Start a github project board to track tasks and share ideas. Find more info and examples [here](boards-and-issues.md)   


## Set Up Bots and CI Tools
* Set up the [aicoe-ci](../develop_collaborate/thoth-tools.md) tools for your repo. These tools can aid in various aspects of your development workflow by running pre-commit checks, build checks, triggering pipelines to build images and more automatically. Find more info on setting up these tools [here](https://github.com/aicoe/aicoe-ci#getting-started).

## Use Open Data Hub and JupyterHub instances

* Sign in to JupyterHub [here](https://jupyterhub-opf-jupyterhub.apps.smaug.na.operate-first.cloud/)
* Watch an intro [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI_-lqi3vP4&list=PL8VBRDTElCWpneB4dBu4u1kHElZVWfAwW&index=3) on how to get started.
* Learn how to monitor your resources [here](https://youtu.be/1zZ-7mdxOWU).

## Join the Community! 

* Attend our [meetups](https://www.operate-first.cloud/data-science/operate-first-data-science-community/docs/meetup-landing-page.md).
* Say "Hi" on [Slack](https://operatefirst.slack.com/ssb/redirect) in the #data-science channel.
* Open an [issue](https://github.com/operate-first/support).
