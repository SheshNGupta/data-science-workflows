# How To Create Project Boards and  Use Issues

You can create Issues to highlight new features, bugs and break upcoming goals of a project into smaller chunks. You can create GitHub [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues) and include [Task Lists](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-task-lists) for each task that you plan to work on.

Here is an [example Issue](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/ocp-ci-analysis/issues/279) that we created to highlight a certain task for our project.

We use [project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards) to organize the tasks within the team.

Once your project board is created, begin to create issues and populate the board with them

* Create an issue for every task you plan to work on
    * Break issues down into smaller pieces if they cannot be completed in a single sprint
    * Be specific in the description of the issue 
    * Tag other related issues with a ‘#’ as necessary
    * Provide acceptance criteria for when the issue can be closed 
    * Assign yourself or your teammates who you plan to work with on the task to the issue

* Add the issues to the *New* column of you project board
* When you're almost ready to begin working on an issue, move it to the *To Do* column
* Once you start work on an issue, move it to the *In Progress* column
