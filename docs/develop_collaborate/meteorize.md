 **How to Meteorize the repository**
    - To meteorize your github repository, first start with making a jupyterbook. You can refer to the tutorial [here.](https://github.com/AICoE/meteor/blob/main/docs/build-jupyterbooks.md) 
    - After you have the jupyterbook ready, head to [meteor](https://shower.meteor.zone/) to meteorize the project repository.
