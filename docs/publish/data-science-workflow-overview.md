# Data Science Workflow 

## Start Here: AI Ops DS Project


Please use the following outline to get started with a new AI Ops Data Science Project:


1. Review the project workflow document [here](project-structure.md) 

2. Create a new description using this [template doc](project-document-template.md) 

4. Copy this  [project board](https://github.com/orgs/aicoe-aiops/projects/2) to a new organization level project board
including automation. See [Copying a project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/copying-a-project-board)

5. Request a Ceph bucket  [here]() from the operate first team and  add your data to it (feature currently unavailable)

6. Create a  [CookieCutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#cookiecutter-data-science) formatted
data science project from this [template repo](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/project-template). 
Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) 
if you are unsure how to create a new repo from this template. 


## Expected GitHub Workflow

1. Create an issue for every task you plan to work on
1. Add the issue to the *New* column of the corresponding project board
1. Let somebody from the project team review the issue and refine until it's clear with defined completion conditions:
   1. Provide some sort acceptance criteria
   1. Break the issue into smaller pieces if it can't be done in one sprint
1. Move the issue to the *To Do* column
1. Once you start work on the issue move to the *In Progress* column and assign it to yourself
1. When working on an issue please be sure to use a feature branch in your own fork. Do not work directly on the master 
branch. 
1. When finished, create a PR from your fork's feature branch for the issue and reference the issue in the PR description
1. Let somebody from the team review the PR - never merge your own PRs
