# Data Science Workflow

This repo contains a set of resources, tutorials and general best practices that our team has developed and continues to refine for effectively collaborating as a group of data scientists. Our team relies heavily on the [Open Data Hub](https://opendatahub.io/) (ODH) project (which we also recommend), so many of our examples will use that toolbox. But our hope is that there is enough generally applicable content that this information can be helpful to those outside the ODH ecosystem. Further, we invite others to [contribute](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/data-science-workflows/issues/new) their best practices and implementation alternatives : )
